# Betting Strategy Debunk

This project aims to analyze and debunk a betting strategy proposed by a friend. The strategy suggests that by consistently betting on middle-of-the-leaderboard teams to draw, one can achieve guaranteed winnings. The reasoning behind this strategy is:

1. Middle-of-the-leaderboard teams tend to draw matches frequently.
2. Draw odds are typically high, offering significant returns.
3. If a bet is lost, doubling down on the next bet will eventually recover losses and yield a profit.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to evaluate the validity of this strategy using data analysis and simulations. We aim to determine whether this approach is statistically sound or if it is flawed due to inherent risks and limitations.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical match data, including results and odds for middle-of-the-leaderboard teams.
2. **Simulation**: Implement the betting strategy in a simulated environment to observe outcomes over time.
3. **Analysis**: Evaluate the performance of the strategy, considering factors such as:
    - Win/loss rates
    - Risk of ruin (running out of money)
    - Long-term profitability
4. **Conclusion**: Provide a detailed explanation of the findings and whether the strategy holds up under scrutiny.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Data Sources**: Publicly available football/soccer match data
